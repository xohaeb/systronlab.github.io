The Department of Computer Science invites applications from home students for a fully funded PhD position focused on developing an adaptive Multi-Access Interoperable Communication Fabric for TinyEdge devices. This ambitious project aims to revolutionise IoT TinyEdge networks by improving resource utilisation, seamless connectivity, security, resilience, quality of service, and user experience. The primary objectives include investigating the interoperability requirements of IoT TinyEdge networks and examining overlay networks of various communication technologies, such as Wifi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, 5G, LTE, and LPWAN technologies like Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoraWAN. The student will explore network topologies and TinyEdge architectures, whether distributed or central, to determine the most effective approach for managing and orchestrating services and applications.

## Funding Details

The successful candidate will receive:

- Full tuition fee waiver (home student fees covered).
- An annual stipend to cover living expenses.
- Research expenses for conducting the two use-case studies.
- Travel funds to present findings at international conferences and workshops.

## Eligibility Criteria

Applicants must:

- Hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electronics Engineering, or a related field.
- Have a strong background in network communication, IoT technologies, cyber security and embedded systems.
- Demonstrate proficiency in programming and experience with open-source software development.
- Exhibit strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

## Application Process

Interested candidates should submit the following documents:

- A detailed CV.
- A cover letter explaining their interest in the project and relevant experience.
- Academic transcripts.
- Contact information for at least two academic referees.
- A research proposal outlining their approach to achieving the project objectives (max 2 pages).
