desc: Advancing RAN interoperability by bridging the gap between commercial and open-source E2 nodes and RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
---

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance Radio Access Network (RAN) interoperability by bridging the gap between commercial and open-source E2 nodes and RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). Our in-house developed xApps are adapted to run on these platforms to fetch key performance metrics (KPMs) and perform RAN control.

## Configurations

#### 1. Commercial E2 Node (VIAVI Tester) with Open-Source RIC (OSC)

**GitHub**: [uoy-research/oran-sc-ric-uoy](https://github.com/uoy-research/oran-sc-ric-uoy)<br>  
**Status**: <span style="color: #A95938;">Ongoing</span>

The source code of the OSC RIC was modified to address interoperability issues encountered during its integration with the VIAVI tester. The modified OSC RIC was successfully integrated, and currently our xApp is able to fetch KPMs from the VIAVI tester.

**Upcoming Work:**

- Adding and testing RAN control functions.
- Modifying the in-house developed small cell xApp to work with RAN control functions instead of the REST APIs it currently uses.

#### 2. Open-Source E2 Node (srsRAN) with Open-Source RICs (OSC, FlexRIC)

This segment explores the integration of the open-source E2 node srsRAN with open-source RICs like OSC and FlexRIC. There are three variations of this setup with different software and hardware requirements.

##### 2.1 srsRAN with ZMQ

**GitHub**: [uoy-research/srsRAN-ZMQ](https://github.com/uoy-research/srsRAN-ZMQ)<br>  
**Status**: <span style="color: #609732;">Completed</span>

srsRAN is a 4G and 5G software radio suite that includes a core network, gNB, and user equipment (UE) implementation. While gNB and UE typically use physical radios for over-the-air transmissions, srsRAN also features a virtual radio that uses the ZeroMQ networking library to transfer radio samples between applications. This software-based approach is advantageous for development, testing, debugging, and CI/CD, as it eliminates the need for hardware.

Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project with various configurations (Dockerized 5G core, non-Dockerized 5G core, single UE, multiple UEs, single gNB, multiple gNBs, FlexRIC, OSC RIC) can be found in the GitHub repository.

##### 2.2 Over-the-Air (OTA) Setup

**GitHub**: [uoy-research/srsRAN-USRPs-OTA](https://github.com/uoy-research/srsRAN-USRPs-OTA)<br>  
**Status**: <span style="color: #A95938;">Ongoing</span>

The srsRAN project provides a 5G CU/DU solution but does not include a UE application. However, srsRAN 4G offers a prototype 5G UE (srsUE) for testing. The GitHub repository demonstrates how to create a fully open-source end-to-end 5G network using srsUE, the srsRAN project's gNB, and the Open5GS 5G core network, with a focus on establishing an Over-the-Air (OTA) setup using USRPs.

This setup can be used in labs without a radio license. No antennas are needed; the two USRPs communicate through SMA cables linked with 30dB attenuators.

##### 2.3 USRPs with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs

**GitHub**: [uoy-research/srsRAN-USRPs-COTS](https://github.com/uoy-research/srsRAN-USRPs-COTS)<br>  
**Status**: <span style="color: #A95938;">Ongoing</span>

In this setup, we are utilizing srsRAN as our 5G core, along with two Ettus Research X310 USRPs equipped with an OctoClock-G. The configuration follows an 8-split architecture, featuring eight log-periodic antennas connected to two 2x2 MIMO base stations. Additionally, we have two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipment (UE) devices: one designed for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and the other for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).

#### 4. Open-Source OpenRAN Gym
OpenRAN Gym is an open-source toolbox that allows researchers to develop, test, and deploy AI/ML-based xApps on an O-RAN-compliant network. It provides a software pipeline for data collection, model training, and xApp deployment on RAN systems like srsRAN or OpenAirInterface, running on experimental platforms such as Colosseum or Arena. The platformâ€™s flexibility enables users to collect data and design solutions in simulated environments before deploying them on production networks.

##### 4.1 Configuring SCOPE for Data Collection and RAN Control
SCOPE (Softwarization and Controllability for Open Programmable Environments) serves as the control and data collection layer within OpenRAN Gym, managing RAN slicing, scheduling, and other key performance metrics (KPMs). It builds on top of srsRAN and extends its functionality to support network slicing and dynamic scheduling policies, which can be modified at runtime through APIs.

#### 4.2 Launching ColO-RAN Near-RT RIC in Colosseum
ColO-RAN is the near-real-time RIC used in Colosseum to host and manage xApps within the OpenRAN Gym environment. Configuring it involves setting up Docker containers to manage E2 interface messages, routing, and database storage of RAN node details. 
OpenRAN Gym provides template scripts for creating xApps, which are then packaged as Docker containers and instantiated on the RIC. The experimental environment, Colosseum, supports extensive data collection, generating datasets under varied wireless and traffic conditions.

## Conclusion

Through these initiatives, we are making significant strides in improving RAN interoperability, which is crucial for the advancement of next-generation wireless networks.
